# SESUG 2025

Hello all, welcome to SESUG 2025! Within this repository you will find the presentation materials and programs needed for the PROC SQL Case Study HOW. In the data folder, I have included partial data sets, as the full data sets were too large to upload to github.

# PROC SQL Case Study 
Tuesday, 9/23 
12:30PM - 2:00PM

Ready to sharpen your PROC SQL skills? This session guides you through a series of questions that gradually increase in complexity, each designed to highlight new techniques and problem-solving strategies. Along the way, you’ll learn about statement order and useful options, manipulate data with CASE expressions, and discover the power of dictionary tables. We’ll also cover inner joins, noncorrelated subqueries, data-driven macro variables with the INTO clause, summary functions, boolean expressions, and SET operators. Whether you’re new to PROC SQL or looking to expand your toolkit, this session provides practical examples you can apply immediately in your own work.

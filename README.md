# PROC SQL Case Study 
Tuesday, 9/23 
12:30PM - 2:00PM

Ready to sharpen your PROC SQL skills? This session guides you through a series of questions that gradually increase in complexity, each designed to highlight new techniques and problem-solving strategies. Along the way, you’ll learn about statement order and useful options, manipulate data with CASE expressions, and discover the power of dictionary tables. We’ll also cover inner joins, noncorrelated subqueries, data-driven macro variables with the INTO clause, summary functions, boolean expressions, and SET operators. Whether you’re new to PROC SQL or looking to expand your toolkit, this session provides practical examples you can apply immediately in your own work.
